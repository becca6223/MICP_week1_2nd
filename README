This repo is to program Caesat Cipher in C. 
Files included in this repo: 
  caesar.h (header file)
  caesar.c (source file)
  caesar_main.c (main function)
  testCase.txt (includes the testcases implemented in main function and epected result for each test case)
  out (the executable binary file)

This program does not include error handling. 
(I know it is a good practice to include it :)
The input string format is always assumed correct. 
Ex: number:string -> 100:23#$AB
number will be between -1000000 ~ 1000000., string length will be from 1 ~ 200 characters.

How to encode:
you only encode upper case, lower case characters and digits. Any other special characters will remain the same. 
the number before colon represent number of shifts (right or left) through the alphabet. 
The alphabet is treated as being circular so that the first letter follows after the last letter, 
and the last letter precedes the first letter. (MICP_Week1 power point)
If it is positive number, right shift
If it is negative number, left shift. 
Ex: "1", A -> B, a -> b, 1 -> 2
Ex: "-1", A -> Z, b -> a, 1 -> 0
